Rust Ukraine is a volunteer organization striving to promote Rust Programming language in the country. We run meetups and conferences in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities.

# History

In 2014 [Steve Klabnik](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik) from the Rust Core team came to Kyiv and gave a talk "Rust for Rubyists" at [RubyC conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJrmcTxG_2I). The talk sparked interest to Rust among several members of [Kottans.org](http://kottans.org).

Later that year we run a few informal gatherings at different conferences where we talked about Rust and our experiences learning and playing with the language.

In 2015 Andrey Listochkin and Ivan Lavriv - both Kottans members - ran a **joint Kyiv + Lviv Rust 1.0 release party**. Later that year Ivan ran the second Rust Ukraine meetup.

Since then the informal gatherings continued at various Ukrainian developer conferences and meetups. Notably: Kyiv JS meetups, various City JS conferences, PyCon UA, XP Days, and Lviv Pivorak meetups.

In 2017, **the second [RustFest conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL85XCvVPmGQhvs1Rnet_24B-AI3YSM2YG) took place in Kyiv**, and shortly after we decided to run regular meetups in the city.
